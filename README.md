# The "Fuck You Pay Me" (FYPM) License

The "Fuck You Pay Me" or "FYPM" license is a boilerplate license to use in your proprietary projects. Use it when you wish to share your work for the pleasure of viewing and learning from it, but not the benefit of reusing, distributing, or reselling that work.

Unlike most "open source", this license grants you full access to view the source—and literally nothing else.

Anyone is free to use and adapt this license for their own purposes. (Ironically, the FYPM License itself is licensed under the [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL).)
